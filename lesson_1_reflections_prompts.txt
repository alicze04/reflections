1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Comparing line by line instead of reading the whole document from the top to the bottom. Easier to spot a mistake when comparing two similar lines of code.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

To see the progreess we have made with the code. To be able to come back to the previous version if we want to. When we break something in the new version we can come back to the old version easily.

8.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Save the logical parts of the in code while I'm working on it.
